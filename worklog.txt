-worked on get_image_path() command, used previous lecture recordings to figure out how to use the os library.
-worked on get_apod_info(), wasn't very difficult since it was just making a connection to the NASA API and we've done that a 100 times


2022-04-08
-worked on print_apod_info(), wasn't too much work just printing sentences explaining what the code is doing

2022-04-13
-looking around to figure out how to do the download_apod_image(), created a request to get image url, 
-check the status of the connection and return the image_url if successful

2022-04-20
-attempted to figure out the save_apod_image() command, and gave up after spending nearly 2 hours getting nowhere,
-created the create_image_db(), pretty stright forward since we have already created db's in a previous lab,
- finished create_image_db()

2022-04-22
-started add_image_to_db(), wasn't too much work just making a connection to the db, adding values into table that already exists
-moved on into image_already_in_db(), made a connection to the db, get hash values of all images already in the db,
-check whether the image specified by the date provided as a command line already exists in the db

-attempt to finish the save_image_file(), command and after a couple of hours looking around the internet very confused
still unable to figure out how to save the image
-look in d2l discussions, find another student struggling with the same command, see Jeremy's response and use the template he gave
-unable to fill in the blancks to finish my command
